Start main
  Initialize system, ports, interrupts, crossbar, and system bus
  
  Set pulsewidth to 1.5 ms
  Wait 1 second
  
  Every 80 ms
    Read from the ranger
    Based on the distance read, calculate the new pulsewidth
      // New pulsewidth is between PW_MIN and PW_MAX.
      // A low distance (10 - 40 cm) results in high pulsewidth
      // A high distance (50 - 90 cm) results in low pulsewidth
      // A medium distance (40 - 50 cm) results in neutral
    Print the distance read and the pulsewidth calculated
  End Loop
